Help match up teams for the first round of a seed-based tournament. In a seeded tournament, and during the first round, the top seed is matched with the bottom seed, the 2nd highest team is matched with the second lowest, etc.  

Example:

Seeds
1. Wisconsin
2. Michigan
3. Michigan State
4. Indiana

Matchups:
(1) Wisconsin versus (4) Indiana,
(2) Michigan versus (3) Michigan State 

Create the first round matches for a tournament using seeds.

Your program should include a menu, where you can enter teams, and then seed them.  

Example: 

Welcome to My Tournament Generator. Enter a selection:
1. Enter teams
2. List teams
3. List matchups
0. Exit program
 

Your program should check for the following: 

1. If an odd number of teams are entered, the top-seeded team gets a bye (doesn't play)

Example:

Seeds
1. Wisconsin
2. Michigan
3. Michigan State
4. Indiana
5. Purdue

Matchups: 
(1) Wisconsin has a bye
(2) Michigan versus (5) Purdue
(3) Michigan State versus (4) Indiana

Hints:
You should utilize Classes (probably just one).
Make sure you can do multiple match-ups (that is, match up once, then come back and match-up again).
